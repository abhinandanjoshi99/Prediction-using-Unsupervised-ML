This is done as part of The Sparks Foundation-GRIP Jan 2021 Internship
From the ‘Iris’ dataset, we will predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.

K-Means Classification Clustering is an Unsupervised learning method that allows us to group set of objects based on similar characteristics. We are Finding the optimum number of clusters for k-means classification
